# Shrouded Mirror
## Neural Network-Based Rendering in Interactive Environments

This project uses a feedforward NN, and overfits it to visual observations of some environment to create a visual effect. After training the network takes position and rotation of the environment and produces an output image.

More information, including a gameplay video and screenshots, can be found on [my website](https://www.johannescmayer.com/projects/shroudedmirror/).

This project does not use a GQN (even though it might seem so from the file names).
